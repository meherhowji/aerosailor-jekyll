### Introduction 
React JS is one of my favorite JavaScript framework, my most favorite part is how view and controller are designed, they stay nicely together like young siblings. 

A general try out app for many developers is a todo app but I think a Pomodoro App is an equal competitor but packs less user stories and hence simple enough to execute quickly. 

### User Stories
* A user can start and stop timer by clicking on the respective buttons.
* A user can update the time settings so that a custom timer can be started.
